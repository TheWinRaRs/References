So, one of the first thing that we need when dealing with reverse engineering are tools. Can't do much without them!  

Some of the tools that I like to use are:


- Kali Linux (Yes, I'm counting it as a tool as much as an Operating System. Live with it :) )


- Radare2 and its family

- Ghidra


Those are my main tools for reversing a binary. So, lets get them installed onto our machine. 

We've covered how to install these tools, if you haven't read how to do it, I highly reccomend it.


Other tools that I haven't used, but you may be familiar with them are:


- IDA (Pro)

- Hopper

- dnSpy

- Ollydbg


And many more that I haven't heard of!


Once we've got everything set up, we're good to go!

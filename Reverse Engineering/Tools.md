# Tools
So, one of the first thing that we need when dealing with reverse engineering are tools. Can't do much without them!  

Some of the tools that I like to use are:
* Kali Linux (Yes, I'm counting it as a tool as much as an Operating System. Live with it :) )
* Radare2 and its family
* Ghidra

Those are my main tools for reversing a binary. So, lets get them installed onto our machine.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -> I've covered how to install these tools [here](Tools%20Setup.md)

Other tools that I haven't used, but you may be familiar with them are:
* IDA (Pro)
* Hopper
* dnSpy
* Ollydbg
* Binary Ninja

And many more that I haven't heard of!

Once we've got everything set up, we're good to go!

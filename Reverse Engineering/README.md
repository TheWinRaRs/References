#### Here, I go over the following things:
1) [Tools](Tools.md)

2) [Assembly](Assembly.md)\
&nbsp;* [Registers]()\
%nbsp;* [Syntax](https://github.com/TheWinRaRs/References/blob/master/Reverse%20Engineering/Assembly.md#syntax)\
&nbsp;* [Assembly language]\

3) [CTF tips and tricks](CTF Tips And Tricks.md)

#### I, EuanB26, would just like to point out that I am in no way an expert on the matter, I would just like to educate others out there that might not have any knowledge of RE and are wanting to learn!

#### Here, I go over the following things:
1. [Tools](Tools.md)

2. [Assembly](Assembly.md)
	* [Registers](Assembly.md#registers)
	* [Syntax](Assembly.md#syntax)
	* [Assembly language](Assembly.md#assembly-code)

3. [CTF tips and tricks](CTF%20Tips%20And%20Tricks.md)
